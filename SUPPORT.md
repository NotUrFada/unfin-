## App Store Support URL

Apple requires the Support URL in App Store Connect to point to a **real webpage** (not a raw GitHub file). Use the hosted support page:

1. **Add your support email** in `docs/index.html` (replace `YOUR-SUPPORT-EMAIL@example.com`).
2. **Enable GitHub Pages** for this repo: Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from branch → branch **main**, folder **/docs**.
3. **In App Store Connect**, set Support URL to: **https://noturfada.github.io/unfin-/**
