# Support page for App Store

This folder is the **Support URL** for the app in App Store Connect.

## Setup (one-time)

1. Support email is set to **ezehboynumber2@gmail.com** in `index.html`.

2. **Enable GitHub Pages** for this repo:
   - On GitHub: **Settings** → **Pages**
   - Under "Build and deployment", set **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main** (or **master**), folder: **/docs**
   - Save. After a minute, the site will be at:
     **https://noturfada.github.io/unfin-/**

3. **Set the Support URL in App Store Connect** to:
   **https://noturfada.github.io/unfin-/**

Apple requires a real webpage where users can see support info and contact you; this page satisfies that.
